# Trending
This app was written to display "trending" Github repos. There is no "trending" endpoint in the Github API, so we used:

https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api

Demonstrates retrieval using Retrofit2 and RxJava.

An installable APK is included in the root folder. The app was tested in an Android emulator, and a 6.0 device.
